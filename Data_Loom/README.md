This is a flask app based on the finance pset. It can be run by navigating to the project folder in
and typing 'flask run'. You will be greeted with the log in screen, but you must register first (No worries, this info
stays only on the database no real or email is required). After registering log in to your account. When you
registered a database with your user name is created to store any of your uploaded dataset files and two example
datasets are inserted into the database. The plot page shows a temp plot, you can select glyph 'shape', 'color', 'size', and 'alpha'.
Unfortunately, you are not able to select the 'datasets' or the 'columns' of the tables because this does not work yet.:(
Right now data that is being plotted is being randomly generated by a helper function.
Up in the nav bar the is also a link to 'upload' files. I couldn’t get this page to work ether.:(
That about it, the two things that I really wanted to happen (upload data-files, csv excel, JSON,
and plot the data) are the two major things I couldn’t get to work.
